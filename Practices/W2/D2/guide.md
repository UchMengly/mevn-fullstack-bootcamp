## What is Responsive Design

Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures a website or web application adapts to the user's device and screen size. This ensures that the content looks good and is usable across various devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Principles of Responsive Design:
- Fluid Grids: Instead of fixed-width layouts, use fluid grids that adjust based on the screen size. This ensures that elements on the page resize proportionally.

- Flexible Images and Media: Images and media should also resize based on the screen size. Use relative units like percentages or max-width: 100%; to ensure images scale appropriately.

- Media Queries: Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the screen size and characteristics. This allows you to create breakpoints where the layout changes to accommodate different screen sizes.
